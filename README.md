RDAG is an innovative blockchain project leveraging virtual blocks and Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) technology to address the
      "impossible trinity" (decentralization, security, and high throughput) challenges faced by traditional blockchain technology. RDAG is
      particularly suitable for blockchain-based online games (GameFi), enabling low-latency game interactions through virtual blocks. It
      aims to become the first blockchain natively supporting GameFi.

## DAG GameFi
>  By leveraging virtual blocks and Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) technology, RDAG delivers rapid transaction confirmations, high network throughput, and robust security.

## Virtual Blocks
> One of RDAG's core innovations is the introduction of virtual blocks. 100 virtual blocks are generated every second, which are then
      consolidated into a single real block every minute. This design significantly enhances transaction confirmation speed, improving the
      user experience.

### Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)
>RDAG adopts a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) structure, allowing parallel processing of transactions, greatly increasing network
      throughput and transaction confirmation speed. The DAG structure also inherently provides protection against double-spending attacks,
      enhancing system security.



# rdag - node
Rdag Node Source Code - this repository contains the source code of a full rdag node.

## Prerequisites
To run a rdag node, you need the following spec:
- Bare Metal Server/Computer with at least 8 Cores 
- At least 300GB of RAM
- 2.5Gb/s synchronous internet connection
- A USB Stick or SSD/HD attached to the Computer
- UEFI Bios 



The clock of the node needs to be in sync.
We recommend to synchronize a Linux / Windows / MacOS machine with NTP permanently and run [`rdag-cli -synctime`](https://github.com/rdag/rdag-cli) from that machine regularly, for example once a day with a cronjob.



## Limited Support
We cannot support you in any case. You are welcome to provide updates, bug fixes, or other code changes by pull requests.


# Vision
RDAG is committed to continually optimizing and enhancing its underlying technology, further improving network performance and
      security. Simultaneously, we will actively expand RDAGâ€™s application scenarios, collaborating with partners across various industries
      to drive the development and adoption of blockchain technology.
